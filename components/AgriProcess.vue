	              proprietary methods and technology to the sustainable production of
	              affordable and nutritious food, with a mission of contributing to global
	              food security while advancing the competitiveness and livelihood of
	              farmers and fisherfolk.

		            Through our work with farmers and co-ops in Asia, the Middle East,
		            and Africa, we identified gaps in the supply chain of basic agricultural
		            and food commodities, and recognized the immediate need to bridge
		            these in order to urgently address food insecurity.
	            </p>
	            <br>
	            <p>Opportunities came about through our network to help supply the
		            demand for basic food products and agricultural inputs.</p>
	            <br>
	            <p>We then formed Ten-Eighteen LLC in Dubai, UAE, with a commitment
		            to sourcing and delivering high-quality products in the agricultural
		            and food commodities trading sector.</p>
	            <br>
	            <p>Leveraging our extensive global network of suppliers and partners,
		            Ten-Eighteen strives to bridge the gap between surplus regions and
		            areas in need, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and foodsecure
		            world.</p>
