							the world, and has been included by the World Bank
							among the eight global challenges to address at scale.</p>
						<br>
						<p>According to an October 2023 World Bank report,
							domestic food price inflation remains high across all
							countries. Because of the El Ni√±o phenomenon,
							approximately 100 million people worldwide will need
							food assistance through early 2024, reports the Famine
							Early Warning Systems Network.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The dwindling supply of such major commodities as
							maize, wheat, and rice, has raised concerns. According to
							the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), per capita
							global cereal production growth has slowed significantly.</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Skyrocketing input prices, plus escalating fuel prices,
							labor costs, and machinery expenses further burden
							farmers worldwide and adversely affect food production.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>Furthermore, the agricultural sector has been impacted
							by an extended period of adverse weather conditions
							over decade. Data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel
							on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores a rise in extreme
							weather events and unpredictable climatic patterns,
							affecting crop cycles and yields, and contributing to
							global food insecurity.</p>
